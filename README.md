sys
os
csv
**<p align = "center"> Part 1, Process Scheduling</p>**<br/>
**Background**
Process scheduling algorithms come in many different variations, and they have many
different tradeoffs to consider like resource sharing and simplicity of execution.
Understanding how Shortest Job First and Shortest Remaining Job work will give you
a better understanding of the ways in which these algorithms differ.
_Waiting time_ measures the amount of time from when a process enters the ready
queue to when the process is executed.
_Turn around time_ measures the amount of time from when a process enters the ready
queue to when the process is terminated.
The are both used in operating systems to determine CPU usage efficiency. <br/>
**Directions**
The code for this portion should be written in **Python** (trust me, it's easier
than C). There is a test batchfile for this assignment located in the repo. Each
line of the batchfile contains 4 comma separated values. They are: PID, Arrival
Time, Burst Time (also known as execution time). PID is the process id. Arrival
time is the time since the process arrived in the ready queue. Burst time is the
amount of time required to fully execute the process on the CPU.
Let's look at a simplified example of the batchfile:
<code>
1, 0, 20 TT = 20 WT = 0
3, 0, 50 TT = 86 WT = 36
7, 9, 4 TT = 15 WT = 13
2, 10, 12 TT = 26 WT = 14
</code><br/>
Your program should consist of at least 4 functions: Main, ShortestRemainingSort,
ShortestJobFirstSort, and ComputeStat. [Please note that the way Python implements
main is different than the way that C or C++ implements
it](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-main-function/). Below, I provide the
general description of each of the functions. You will notice that these
descriptions are much less comprehensive than the first assignment. This is because
I would like you to begin working on implementing algorithms from a general
description (much like you would in an interview).
Name your program _schedulingAlgorithms.py_
You can implement sorting in many ways in Python: you can take your data and create
a tuple (or other object) and sort a list of those objects, you can zip, sort and
unzip lists, you can create parallel lists and sort (not recommended since mistakes
with this method are common), etc. In each of the sort functions, it is up to you
to decide what data structures and process you use to implement the sorting
algorithm.
If you want to create a list of dict objects containing each of the variables and
sort by key or item, that's fine. Or you could create three separate lists (one for
PID, one for arrival time, and one for burst time) and sort them using zip/unzip.
There are many ways to sort in python, so pick whatever makes the most sense to
you. You can find sorting options
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html), though you are not limited to
these.
_main()_<br/>
From the terminal, the user should be able to enter the program name batchfile name
and type of process sort they would like to do. (In other words, you should not
hardcode the batchfile name).
So for example: python3 _schedulingAlgorithms.py pa2_batchfile.txt SJF could be
entered on the commandline when you want to run the program. If the user does not
enter your three arguments (program name batchfileName and sortType), then you
should return 1 for failure and print the following:
<code>
Please provide command line arguments when running.
python3 _schedulingAlgorithms.py batchfile.txt ShortestRemaining
</code><br/>
There are many ways to accomplish this check. You will likely want to _import sys_
and use sys.argv to get all of the arguments given from the command line.
Once the user supplies the correct number of arguments (which you can get by taking
the length of the sys.argv list, see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-
line-arguments-in-c-cpp/)),
use argv to get the batch file name, and then read all of the data from it, if you
can. If you can't (because the user entered a non-existent file name),
you should return 1, and print the following:
<code>
Input batchfile not found!
</code><br/>
If you're able to read from the file name provided by the user (again there are
many ways to do this, but I like using
[_readlines()_](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_open.asp)), then you
should get the algorithm name from the argv list. Expected algorithm names supplied
by the user are SJF (for shortest job first) and SRJ (for shortest remaining job).
Please make sure the spelling and capitalization match for testing.
If the user does not provide one of these arguments, you should return 1 and output
the following:
<code>
Unidentified sorting algorithm. Please input either SRJ or SJF.
</code><br/>
If the user enters an acceptable algorithm name, perform a logical check to see
which function you should call ( SRJ or SJF). Call the appropriate algorithm, which
returns a list of process execution times and sorted (by algorithm) PIDs. Call
ComputeStats to get the average wait time and average turnaround time. For each
algorithm, the output to the terminal should be the processes in the order that
they should execute (each on their own line), the average process waiting time, and
the average process turn around time, each on their own line.
All input and output should be gathered and executed IN MAIN. In other words, your
reading and printing should happen there.
Examples of output for each algorithm are below, but please make sure that you
print from main.
The easiest way to do that is to have each of the algorithm functions return a list
of the times that each process is completed at.Then you can pass that and the
relevant data to ComputeStats, whose returns can be used to print the turnaround
and wait times.<br/>
_ComputeStat(processCompletionTimes, processArrivalTimes, processBurstTimes)_<br/>
**Parameters**: accepts the time that the process would be completed at by the
algorithm, accepts the time that each process arrives (I suggest using two lists)
**Returns**: (1)the average turnaround, (2)a list of each process turnaround times,
(3)the average wait time and (4)a list of each process wait times (note: Python
will let you return multiple values at once. For ease of implementation, you should
do that in this function)
This function calculates your average turnaround time and average wait time stats,
as well as the turnaround and wait time for each process (as lists).
Turnaround time is calculated by subtracting each processArrivalTime from its final
processCompletionTime. For example, using FCFS process 3 takes 50 seconds to
execute and arrived at time 0, so process 3 has a turnaround time of 70 because it
has to wait 20 seconds for process 1 to fully execute. To calculate the average,
sum each process' turnaround time, and divide by the number of processes. So if we
only executed process 1 and 3, we would add 20 and 70 and divide by 2- the
turnaround time of those two processes averaged (ignoring the rest of the list for
simplicity) is 45.
Wait time is calculated by subtracting each processBurstTime from its
processTurnaroundTime. For example, using FCFS, we previously calculated that
process 3 has a turnaround time of 70, and process 1 has a turnaround time of 20.
To calculate the waitTime for process 3, we subtract the burst time from the
turnaround (70-50) and get 20; doing the same for process 1, we get 0. To calculate
the average, sum each process' wait time, and divide by the number of processes. So
if we only executed process 1 and 3, we would add 20 and 0, and divide by 2- the
wait time of those two processes averaged (ignoring the rest of the list for
simplicity) is 10.<br/>
_ShortestRemainingSort(batchFileData)_<br/>
**Parameters**: accepts all of the batchFileData from the batchfile opened in main
**Returns**: (1) a list (or other data structure) of the time each process is
completed at, and (2) a list (or other data structure) containing the PID of the
processes in the order the algorithm sorted them by.
If the command line argument states that the user wants to process batch jobs using
SRJ, then this function will be called. The data from the batchfile should be
passed in and sorted by arrival time (again, there are many ways to do this). For
this version of shortest remaining, as processes arrive, they are added to the
queue. If the burst time of the newest process in the queue is less than the
remaining time to execute the current process, the current process should be added
back to the queue and the new process should be executed. So in the batchfile
above, process 1 and 3 arrive at the same time, but process 1 has a burst time of
20 seconds, so we run process 1. At time = 9, process 7 enters the queue. Process 1
has 11 seconds of execution remaining. Process 7 has a burst time of 4. Therefore,
we will pause process 1, save its new burst time (which is the remaining time), and
execute process 7. At time 10, process 2 enters the queue. The current process, PID
7, has 3 seconds remaining until full execution, while process 2 needs 12 seconds
to fully execute. Therefore, we continue to execute PID 7 until it completes, and
check the queue for the process with the shortest remaining burst time- in this
case, we would run PID 1 until it is fully executed, then PID 2, then PID 3. This
would complete the batch file's process scheduling algorithm. The basic algorithm
can be summarized as:
At each time (think for loop)
Check what processes have arrived in the queue.
Compare the arrived process' burst time to the time that remains for the
current process to fully execute.
If the newest process has a shorter burst time than the remaining time on the
current process, update the burst time for the current process to be the remaining
time. Then execute the new process with the shorter burst time.
Otherwise, continue executing the current process and decrement its remaining
time.
If two processes arrive at the same time and have the same burst time, execute
the process with the smaller PID first
The simplest way to check "at each time" is to sort all of the processes by arrival
time, but there are a multitude of ways to simulate ShortestRemaining. There are
many different ways to update your process queue from the batch file. You can swap
items in the batchFileData list. You can construct a dictionary object that tracks
each process and the remaining burst time. You can simply update the burst time of
a process each time you would have to pause the process.
Finally, print the PID values of the processes in the order that they will be
executed by the algorithm, the average process waiting time, and average process
turn around time. Using the example batchfile, the input would look like this:
<code>
python3 schedulingAlgorithms.py pa2_batchfile.txt SRJ
</code><br/>
And the output (FROM MAIN BASED ON YOUR RETURNED VALUES) would be:
<code>
PID ORDER OF EXECUTION:
1
7
1
2
3
Average Process Turnaround Time: 35.00
Average Process Wait Time: 13.5
</code><br/>
_ShortestJobFirstSort(batchFileData)_ <br/>
Parameters: accepts all of the batchFileData from the batchfile opened in main
Returns: (1) a list (or other data structure) of the time each process is completed
at, and (2) a list (or other data structure) containing the PID of the processes in
the order the algorithm sorted them by.
If the command line argument states that the user wants to process batch jobs using
SJF, then this function will be called. The data from the batchfile should be
passed in and sorted by arrival (again, there are many ways to do this). The basic
algorithm can be summarized as:
At time 0:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the process that has the shortest burst
time at time 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully execute the selected process
After the first process ends at TimeE:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find all processes that arrived prior to time E
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the
process that has the shortest burst time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully
execute the selected process
Repeat the previous step using the most recent end time as TimeE
If multiple processes are available and have the same burst time, choose the one
with the lower PID (lower PID usually indicates higher importance.)
Finally, print the PID values of the processes in the order that they will be
executed by the algorithm, the average process waiting time, and average process
turn around time. Using the example batchfile, the input would look like this:
<code>
python3 schedulingAlgorithms.py pa2_batchfile.txt SJF
</code><br/>
And the output (FROM MAIN BASED ON YOUR RETURNED VALUES) would be:
<code>
PID ORDER OF EXECUTION:
1
7
2
3
Average Process Turnaround Time: 36.75
Average Process Wait Time: 15.75
</code><br/>
**Part 1 Requirements and Hints**:
Part 1 should be done in python3 (trust me, even with a learning curve, this is
going to be way simpler in Python- I would prefer you have an understanding of the
algorithms over an understanding of c syntax). <br/>
Note that the test batch file for grading will be different than the supplied batch
file. Make sure you test a few different scenarios to ensure your algorithms are
working right. <br/>
You do not need to actually create processes to implement these algorithms. You are
simply deciding the order that processes would execute in, then outputting that,
the average turnaround time, and the average wait time. <br/>
All file input and output should be performed in main. Nothing should be printed
from the process sorting functions, or the averageWait or averageTurnaround
functions. <br/>
**<p align = "center"> Part 2, Memory</p>**<br/>
[vmstat](), [top](), and [free]() are all commonly used linux system memory tools.
Using the links above as reference for flags and formatting, create a .sh script
named _memoryCheck.sh_ that runs each of the commands and save their output to a
file. You may use whichever flags you would like with each tool, so long as you can
answer the questions below based on that output, and your .sh code eventually
terminates. You can use the [cat](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cat-command-in-
linux-with-examples/) command to copy the information from your terminal into a
file. The files should be named ```vmstat.txt```, ```top.txt```, and ```free.txt```
Once the output has been saved, answer the following in a txt file named
```answers.txt```:
1) What is the difference between the 3 tools?
2) You're working on an ubuntu system when you notice that the system has become
less responsive to your clicks. What could be happening in memory to slow the
system? Which of the 3 commands would be most appropriate to check if that's the
case?
3) You're working on an ubuntu system when you get a message saying that there
isn't enough free memory to save your text file. Would this indicate that RAM or
your HDD is full? Which command of the 3 above would be the fastest way to check
the cause of the message?
4) You would like to know how often processes are being interrupted or page
faulting, and how much memory has been reserved to swap pages on and off RAM. Which
command is best for that? What entries would you look at?
**To Submit**<br/>
When you are done, you should create a compressed file (.zip or .tar.gz)
containing the files below, and submit to webcampus.
1) _schedulingAlgorithms.py_
2) _answers.txt_
